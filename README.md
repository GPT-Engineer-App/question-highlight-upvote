# question-highlight-upvote

Update to the Q&A bulletin board app: Remove the answer button from the question list area. Instead, highlight a question when clicked, and provide an answer button within that screen. Additionally, add an upvote button to the highlighted question screen, allowing users to upvote once per person. The upvote button should also allow users to undo their upvote by clicking it again.
